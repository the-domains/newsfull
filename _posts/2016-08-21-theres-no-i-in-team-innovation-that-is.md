  Senior leaders and their teams, regardless of industry, remain under intense
  pressure to innovate. Take the pharmaceutical industry, for example. The
  barriers to get new drugs approved grow larger, more complex and more costly.

  waiting, any way to get one step closer to a novel therapy addressing unmet
  medical need is worthy of pursuit.
